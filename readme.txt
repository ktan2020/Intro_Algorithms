| Introduction: |
\---------------/

This project grew out of a need to rapidly prototype and test "tried and true"
algorithms from *THE* authoritative source. In the past, I had needed to use
'canned' algorithms (as in lifted straight out of *THE* textbook and as close to 
pseudocode form as possible) without having to deal with language-specific
syntaxes, quirks, IDE and/or compiler-related issues.

The language of choice for this project is Groovy. (http://www.groovy-lang.org/)
The conciseness and expressivity of Groovy facilitates rapid prototyping and 
fast development. No IDE's are required, instead the "IDE" of choice is 
groovyconsole.

| Testing: |
\----------/

To run the unittests:

gradlew test


A report will be generated in build/reports/tests/index.html

There are no solutions to exercises here. Just a stable platform on 
which to rapidly test and validate your understanding of all algorithms from 
the textbook. I hope the source code can be of use to you as much as it has 
aided me in my understanding and learning of concepts from the book.

See docs/readme.md for more details.
